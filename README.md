# TensorFlow Projects

A collection of TensorFlow projects focusing on **binary classification**, **data augmentation**, and image classification using the **Intel Image Classification Dataset**. Projects include building CNN models, applying data augmentation techniques to improve generalization, and classifying images into 6 categories (e.g., mountains, forests, buildings).

## Key technologies:
- TensorFlow, Keras
- Data Augmentation
- Transfer Learning with VGG16/ResNet
